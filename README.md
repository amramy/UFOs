# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis: 
Our task is to help Dana build a webpage in which we can see and filter a table of data about UFO sightings. We would like the user to be able to modify the table with multiple filters that include date, city, state, country, and shape. 

### Results: 
With our website up and running you can read the blurb and scroll through the table of UFO sightings. The user can now filter the table with multiple settings. 

##### The Truth is Out There
This image shows what the user will see upon arrival at our website

##### One Filter Example
This example is filtering the table using "fl" Florida as a filter.

##### Two filter Example
This example is filtering the table using "fl" Florida as the state and "fireball" as the shape.

### Summary: 

#### Drawbacks: 
One drawback to this webpage is that the input for the filters is case sensitive. As most people are accustomed to typing state abbreviations with capital letters and it may be confusing and frustrating why inputting capitals would not create an output. 

#### Recommendations: 
Recommendations for further development of this webpage would be:
  * Case insensitivity for all filters except for the date filter.
  * Include a button to search filters after the inputs have been made. 
    * Hitting enter after the user makes an entry may or may not be intuitive. 
  * Include a form a user could complete to submit a UFO observation to be reviewed then added to the dataset.
